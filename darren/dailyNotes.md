- Read and learned about the central node of MINTS sensors and its components. The central node consists of an array of other modules designed to gather data about the environment like air, light, and sound.
- Read and learned specifically about the LoRa node. The LoRa node runs without human aid through the use of solar power and allows for long range communication with the centrla node.

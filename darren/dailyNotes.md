- Read and learned about the central node of MINTS sensors and its components. The central node consists of an array of other modules designed to gather data about the environment like air, light, and sound.
  -  Main module: does the computing and houses a radiation sensor.
  -  Air module: measures particulate matter and estimates concentrations of CO2, CO, NO2, C2H6OH, H2, NH3, CH4, C3H8, and C4H10.
  -  Light module: detects intensity peaks for a wavelength range of 300-1,100 nm and captures photos of the sky.
  -  Ozone module: determines ozone concentration by utilizing the Beer Lambert Law.
  -  Sound and Lightning Module: carries out audio surveillance for urban sounds and noise monitoring for sound pollution.
  -  LoRa module: see below.
  -  Power module: satisfies power requirements.
  -  GPS module: Provides location coordinates, speed, and altitude.
  -  AirMar weather station: measures various weather-related variables like temperature, pressure, and humidity.
- Read and learned specifically about the LoRa node. The LoRa node runs without human aid through the use of solar power and allows for long range communication with the central node.
  - Solar module: consists of two solar panels which the LoRa node uses to capture solar energy.
  - Battery module: works with the solar module to provide consistent power to the system.
  - Main module: transfers data from air module to the central node, incorporates a GPS sensor, and uses a breakout timer to allow the node to function without human aid.
  - Air module: consists of various sensors that measure particulate matter, temperature, humidity, pressure, and the concentrations of many gases.

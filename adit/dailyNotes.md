# Daily Notes 

## July 5th, 2021
- Got a grasp of the scope of the 3 tasks for the project 
- Familiarized myself with the EPA sensors and specifically the sensor located at Haws Athletic Center, Fort Worth, TX
- Worked with my partner to obtain the different parameters to get the API calls for 2020 and 2021 at HAC 
- Set up a Julia workspace with VSCode, and practiced pushing code to Github from VSCode (https://github.com/ashetty2308/JuliaPractice)

## July 6th, 2021
- Worked with partner to parse the EPA API and attempted to get the node data from the UTD sensor 

## July 7th, 2021
- Read the ML paper on sensor calibration and took notes
- Worked on using HDF5 to open the .mat file of node data (trying to see if there is a way to convert it to .mat v7.3) - https://juliahub.com/docs/HDF5/L7Dga/0.13.2/

## July 9th, 2021
- Working on reframing the node data using the reframe function in Python 
- Able to reframe time in a chronological sequence starting from 0, working on reframing the actual data now 
  - Dealing with NaN values being shown in the reformat, working on getting the appropriate data 
- Developed Python algorithm for resampling hourly data 
## July 13th, 2021
- Worked on trying to resample hourly data using Julia 
## July 14th, 2021
- Continued to attempt resampling with Julia 
## July 15th, 2021
- Worked on reformating time data to make it favorable to Julia (specific order of time is needed for resampling)
